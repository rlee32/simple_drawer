This code reads in point coordinates and outputs images of points or segments 
drawn between points. CImg is used.

# Input File Format

If we denote 'N' as the number of points, the following point coordinate file 
format is assumed:

<N>
0 <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate>
1 <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate>
2 <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate>
3 <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate>
....
<N-1> <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate>

# Compilation

Compile with 'make'.
